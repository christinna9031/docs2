title: "CSV Get Box"
num: 17
---

Retrives a value from a box in an existing CSV file. When retrieving values using 'Column/Row Name', the name in the yellow boxes have to be wrapped in `""` as the names are strings. If you use Column/Row Number instead, the number you input into the yellow boxes does not have to be wrapped in `""`. 

When you use column/row numbers, keep in mind the numbers begin with 0,0. The left-most column in a CSV file is column 0. The first row below the row of column names is row 0.
