A CSV file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values.\
CSV files consist of data arranged in rows and columns. SAMMI has the functionality to load, save, set, edit, and manipulate the values within these rows and columns. These values can be saved as variables to be used in any way you want within the SAMMI environment.
