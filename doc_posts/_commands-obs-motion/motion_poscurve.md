Gradually moves a Source from point A to point B over a given duration and curves it in a circle pattern.\
You can make a source complete a half circle or have a slight curve in its transition.\
If you want to move a source from its current position, you can use the command OBS Pull Source Value Value to find current source's X and Y position and incorporate it into this command.
