title: "Motion: Source Scale"
num: 2
---
Gradually resizes a source from Size A to size B over a given duration.\
Due to the way the OBS source resizing work, the result might look a bit snappy sometimes.\
The way the source is resized is based on what the source's point of origin is set to in OBS.\
You can use negative values for a horizontal (mirror) or vertical source flip.\
You can use OBS Pull Source Value command to find current source's X and Y size and incorporate it into this command.
