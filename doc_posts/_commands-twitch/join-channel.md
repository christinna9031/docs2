This command lets you join any Twitch chat channel.\
You do not need to use this command to join your own channel as long as it's linked to SAMMI, as it will join the chat automatically as soon as you launch Bridge.

{% include alert.html text="Use this command to join any alternate accounts you have linked to SAMMI and wish to listen to the chat traffic on." type="info" %}
