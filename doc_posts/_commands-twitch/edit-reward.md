Updates a Custom Reward created on your channel. This means that the reward must show that it is 'Owned' by SAMMI in the Twitch Connections > Edit Channel Points window.

Selecting 'Dupe' in the Edit Channel Points window allows you to duplicate your existing Twitch-created Channel Point Rewards so that they are created and owned by SAMMI. Once you have duplicated the rewards you want, go back into Twitch and delete your Twitch-created rewards.
