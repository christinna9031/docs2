SAMMI has some very useful internal triggers.\
For example, you can make your buttons automatically trigger every time you start SAMMI, when you press a specific hotkey or put them on a timer.

#### Add a new trigger
You can attach a trigger by right clicking on a button - Add/Edit Twitch Triggers, clicking on the + sign and selecting one of the General Triggers.
In your button commands, use [Trigger Pull Data]({{ "commands/trigger#triggerpulldata" | relative_url }}) command to retrieve all the provided information from the event.

#### Trigger types
