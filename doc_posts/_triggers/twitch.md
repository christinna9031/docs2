SAMMI can listen to Twitch events and automatically execute your buttons. For example, it can automatically trigger a button every time you get a new subscriber.

#### Add a new trigger
1. Right click on a button in SAMMI - **Edit Triggers** (or CTRL + double click).
2. Click on the **+** button and select the Twitch trigger type.
3. Fill out the fields and options for the selected trigger (read below) and press Save.
4. Optionally you can right click on a button - **Edit Settings** and check  `Add to Request Queue`, which acts as a button queue. If there is another trigger event while the button is still active (for example if you get two subscribers at the same time), it will place is in the queue and reactivate the button as soon as it's ready again.
4. In your button commands, use [Trigger Pull Data]({{ "commands/trigger#triggerpulldata" | relative_url }}) command to retrieve all the provided information from the event (viewer's name, their message, emotes, badge etc.).
