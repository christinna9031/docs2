To connect to and control OBS, SAMMI uses an add-on called the OBS WebSocket.

You can find a link to the latest compatible version of the WebSocket in the [Step-by-step Tutorial](https://sammi.solutions/docs/getting-started/step-by-step).

Try these steps to troubleshoot the connection between SAMMI and OBS WebSockets:

- **OBS Studio 28 and OBS Websockets**\
If you have just downloaded OBS Studio 28, it comes bundled with OBS Websocket 5.0. This means that if you are running SAMMI using the OBS Websocket 4.9.1 protocol, you will not be able to connect to OBS. 

Instead, you will either have to: 
1. Switch to the OBS Websocket 5.0 protocol in SAMMI and make the necessary changes to your Fetch OBS Data, Custom Packet and Send OBS Requests to reflect the correct OBS Websocket 5.0 protocol syntax and change your OBS Triggers, OR 
2. Download the OBS Websocket 4.9.1-compat plugin [HERE](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/releases), and create a new OBS instance in SAMMI to run the OBS Websocket 4.9.1 protocol. All your commands will have to specify which OBS Websocket protocol you want SAMMI to use.

It is important to check in Tools > Websocket Settings that the OBS Websocket server is currently running with the correct ports. 

- **Run as administrator**\
Try running SAMMI as an administrator. Right click on the SAMMI launch file and select `Run as administrator`.

- **Check your firewall and antivirus**\
Make sure your firewall is not blocking SAMMI.\
You can try [temporarily disabling your antivirus/firewall](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-off-defender-antivirus-protection-in-windows-security-99e6004f-c54c-8509-773c-a4d776b77960) or [adding an exception](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26) to allow the app through.

- **Verify password settings**\
The password you enter in OBS > Tools > WebSockets Server Settings must match the password you enter in SAMMI > OBS Connections. If you do not use a password, uncheck Enable authentication.

- **Verify ports settings**\
The port entered in OBS > Tools > WebSockets Server Settings must match the port in SAMMI > OBS Connections.\
The default port for WebSockets 4.x.x is 4444. The default for WebSockets 5.x.x is 4455.\
Note that this port MUST be different from the port number used in your Bridge settings.

- **Try Non-Blocking Connection**\
In SAMMI, go to OBS Connections and check/uncheck "Non-Blocking".

- **Change IP connection**\
Normally you will use 127.0.0.1 to connect to OBS, but you can try local IP as well:
1. Launch command line (cmd.exe) and run `ipconfig` command.
2. Note down your IPv4 address (it will start with `192.168`).
3. Go to SAMMI > OBS Connections and change the IP address.

- **Try connecting using other means**\
You can try a chrome extension [Simple Websocket Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-websocket-client/pfdhoblngboilpfeibdedpjgfnlcodoo) to check if you can make a connection in the first place.
