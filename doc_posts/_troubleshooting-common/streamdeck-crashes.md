If you press 'Connect' in your SAMMI Deck and nothing happens (you only see the progress icon), it means it hasn't established a successful connection to SAMMI Core.

- **Outdated SAMMI Deck**\
Make sure you're using the latest version of SAMMI Deck. 

- **Mismatched port/password settings**\
Confirm that the Port and Password entered there match the Port and Password in your SAMMI Deck connection settings. The default port is 9425.\
Please note that these settings are separate from those used by OBS WebSockets, and must use a different port number.

- **Blocked by firewall**\
Make sure your firewall is not blocking SAMMI.\
You can try [temporarily disabling your antivirus/firewall](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-off-defender-antivirus-protection-in-windows-security-99e6004f-c54c-8509-773c-a4d776b77960) or [adding an exception](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26) to allow the app through.

- **Unable to connect to the Android App**\
Make sure your firewalls/antivirus has whitelisted the app.\
Make sure both your PC and your mobile device is on the **same network**.\
VPNs do not work well with the mobile app, so make sure you have disabled your VPN settings.\
