### PC Version
Desktop version of SAMMI Deck can be found at `SAMMI/SAMMI Deck` folder. You can also open it by pressing SAMMI Deck button in the main menu in SAMMI.\
Once launched, you will see connection settings. Default IP address for SAMMI is always `127.0.0.1` and port is always `9425`. Unless you changed port in your SAMMI-settings, you can leave it at its default value.\
**You must fill out the password if you decided to use one in SAMMI-Settings menu.**\
Note that you only need to do this once, as your SAMMI Deck will remember the previous settings.
