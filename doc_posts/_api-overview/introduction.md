There are two ways to communicate with SAMMI: 

1. Via its websocket which is implemented in Bridge
2. Via its API 

While SAMMI's websocket is convenient for continuous back and forth communication with faster responses, its implementation is a bit more complicated.\
On the other hand, if you only need to request or send one piece of information at the time, you can simply call SAMMI's API with a HTTP request, coming from your browser, command line or a third party app that can execute it.
