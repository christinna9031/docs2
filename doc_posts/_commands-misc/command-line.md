title: Command Line
num: 5

Execute a command line command just like you do in Command Prompt. Only one line of code.\
If SAMMI is running as admin, commands you perform will also run as admin.\
If you want to execute more than one line of code or the command is not executed properly, convert it to a batch file and use Execute program command instead.

{% include alert.html text="You can use <code>|clip</code> at the end of your command to copy the result to your clipboard and then use Load Clipboard command to load it back into SAMMI." type="info" %}
