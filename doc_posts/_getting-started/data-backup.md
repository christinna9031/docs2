#### Auto Update SAMMI Core
SAMMI comes with an auto-updater that allows you to update or verify the Receiver, SAMMI Deck and Bridge. While SAMMI is running, right-click on the SAMMI icon in your system tray and select `Check for Updates`. 

If there are updates available, you will be able to update or verify the SAMMI components to make sure you are on the latest version. 

#### Back up your data
SAMMI is a self contained app in the SAMMI folder, you do not go through the process of installing it like with other apps.
This means you can freely copy the whole SAMMI folder to another computer and it will work just the same!

Unlike LioranBoard 1, your decks are no longer individually saved as configX.ini files. Instead, your decks are now saved as a json file that you can locate in the folder named `json` in your SAMMI folder. Back up deck files are created automatically by SAMMI, called `decks_data_old.json` and `decks_data_veryold.json`. 

Your current decks are saved as `decks_data.json`.
