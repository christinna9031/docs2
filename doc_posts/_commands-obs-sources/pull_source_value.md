title: "Pull Source Value"
num: 0
---

Pulls the last known value of a source. Will return 0 if the source doesn't exist.\
Very useful command to use together with Motion commands. For example, you can pull the current X and Y position of a source and then use [Motion: Source Position]({{ "commands/obs-motion#motionsourceposition" | relative_url }}) to smoothly move it across the screen.

{% include alert.html text="This command might not work correctly if the source is inside a group. It's recommended to use nested scenes instead." type="danger" %}
