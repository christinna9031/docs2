SAMMI fully supports creating, reading, writing and modifying INI and CSV files.


With [Buffer commands]({{ "commands/buffer#introduction" | relative_url }}), SAMMI can create, read, write and modify any file as well, however it's not as straight forward as using INI/CSV commands and requires some further knowledge.
