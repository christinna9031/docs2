Making your own buttons in SAMMI is a little bit like programming. It takes some time to learn how everything works and SAMMI does take a bit of elbow grease as it is a program that has very advanced capabilities. It may be daunting at first, but once you get the hang of the logic, the world is your oyster! 

You can start with something as small as making a button to change your OBS scene and slowly work towards more complex buttons.

This documentation should help you achieve that!

*We welcome new members on our Discord server to ask questions if they encounter a problem with their buttons or commands, but discourage asking for a whole custom button to be created just for their needs. In that case you're free to request a commission instead.*
